Short Description of the Project:
Florence is a Virtual medical assistant who can put a full stop to the hassle every users face while taking a doctor's appointment, finding a proper hospital nearby, knowing the health issue or simply the crowd of the pharmacy. To solve this Florence fixes appointments on its own either a regular or emergency one, allows users to find hospitals nearby and also allows a pick-up function where users can pick medicines up from the pharmacy without being in a crowd. Plus the user's medical report can also be accessed at any point of time.
